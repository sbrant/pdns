	This app provides an interface and workflow to view and investigate passively collected, local DNS data. It flags DNS
    activity involving blacklisted domains (knowns). It also assists by providing potential indicators (unknowns) of 
    nefarious activity in the DNS realm, such as exfiltration. Any individual row can be clicked on to drill down to 
    additional detail.

    The app was build with compatibility for the <a href="http://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/CIM/latest/User/Overview" target="_blank">Splunk CIM (Common Information Model)</a> in mind.
    Provided your DNS data sources are configured with <a href="http://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/CIM/latest/User/NetworkResolutionDNS" target="_blank">CIM field extractions, eventtypes, and tags</a>, this app should work as advertised.

	Any domain name blacklist can be utilized for this app. There is a sample blacklist and a script to build that 
    blacklist included. The sample blacklist is courtesy of <a href="http://www.malwaredomains.com" target="_blank">Malware Domains</a>.
